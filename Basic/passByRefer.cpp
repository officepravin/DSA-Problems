/*
Certainly! The given code defines a function named `solve` that returns a pointer to an integer. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. Inside the `solve` function:
   - It declares an integer variable `a` and assigns it the value `5`.
   - It then declares an integer pointer variable `ans` and initializes it with the memory address of the integer variable `a`. This means that `ans` points to the memory location where the value of `a` is stored.

2. The function then returns the pointer `ans`.

However, there's a potential issue with this code:
- The variable `a` is a local variable inside the `solve` function.
- When the function `solve` completes execution, the local variables go out of scope.
- Returning a pointer to a local variable that goes out of scope can lead to undefined behavior, as the memory location being pointed to might not contain valid data anymore.

In other words, once the `solve` function finishes, the memory occupied by the `a` variable could be reclaimed for other purposes, and using the returned pointer `ans` might lead to accessing invalid or unexpected data.

If you want to return a pointer to an integer that persists outside the scope of the function, you should allocate memory dynamically using `malloc` (or similar) and ensure to free it when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
